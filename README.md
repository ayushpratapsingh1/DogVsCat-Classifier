# DogVsCat-Classifier
Built a CNN model to classify cats and dogs.

Dataset: Use the 2500 labelled photos of dogs and cats from Kaggle.
Model: Utilising Python and Keras, create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

> Steps: Adjust, normalise, and enhance photos before processing them.
> <br>Algos: Convolutional layers, pooling, and fully connected layers make up the CNN architecture.
> <br>Technologies & Tools: CNNs, Python, and Keras.
